                            <p>Maritime arbitration is an alternative means of handling conflicts, including shipping disputes, outside of the court system. In general, arbitration serves as a key tool to help various parties come to an agreement without litigating or using the judicial system. In arbitration, the parties to a conflict agree to hire a third party to provide an impartial opinion, which may be the final word on something that has the potential to become a thorny and protracted legal battle.</p>
                            <p>Different kinds of arbitration apply to different maritime cases. Some kinds of arbitration are binding, which means the parties agree to abide by the finding of the arbiter. In other kinds of arbitration, called “non-binding,” the opinion presented is solely as a reference for further action. Other forms of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) include mediation, where the third party also acts as a resource.</p>
                            <p>Maritime arbitration can apply to a range of situations. In some cases, disagreements over the shipping and handling of sea-bound freight can generate the need for a panel of arbiters to rule on a maritime issue. There are also many cases where maritime work injury disputes can use arbitration. Specific laws on protections for maritime workers and unions contribute to the need for legal alternatives when conflicts arise between an employer and workers.</p>
