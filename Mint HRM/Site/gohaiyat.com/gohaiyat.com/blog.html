                                    <p>Everyone can be creative. Yet many of us often stick to safe routines or tried
                                        and tested ways. Creativity is best "learned" through self-discovery and
                                        experiential learning rather than traditional lecturing in a classroom. Doing
                                        something different from our normal routine and venturing out of our comfort
                                        zones can often help us view problems or challenges in new perspectives and make
                                        us gain fresh insights about ourselves. </p>

                                    <p>I am a workaholic. One day, I woke up and decided I needed to change my routine.
                                        I enrolled in an art class.</p>

                                    <p>My journey began with watercolour painting and I was surprised by the scientific
                                        approach to create something artistic. But it bode well for me, and that is when
                                        I discovered my "talent." I amazed myself by producing an array of "beautiful"
                                        art pieces. They were adjudged to be so good that a local art gallery invited me
                                        to showcase my pieces.</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <p>I was proud of my progress and was motivated to continue sharpening my skills. In no
                                time, I began singing the mantra "everyone can paint." It all boiled down to technique
                                and practice. It was about taking something I like and replicating it. I was getting
                                really good at it. I felt good being recognized and commended for my talent.</p>

                            <p>Deep down inside though, I felt trapped, as I was nothing more than a great "copycat." I
                                was a diligent pupil and followed the rules of watercolour painting to a tee. I am
                                probably better than average, but I was nothing special.</p>

                            <p>Disheartened, I decided to rediscover myself. I wanted to unravel the creative secrets,
                                to explore new perspectives, and experience new possibilities. I stepped out of my
                                comfort zone and I began oil painting lessons.</p>

                            <div class="img-block">
                                <div class="img-wrp">
                                    <img src="images/blog/creativity/apple.jpg" alt="">
                                </div>
                                <div class="details">
                                    <p>My new teacher taught me to look at an object and make it come alive on my
                                        canvas. For my
                                        first attempt, I was given an apple to paint. I thought it would be easy, until
                                        I had to
                                        battle with different lighting angles. After several lessons, I went to class
                                        only to
                                        find that my apple had been eaten! The significance was far-reaching for a then
                                        beginner
                                        like me. I had to continuously adapt myself to the changes that affected the
                                        apple. It
                                        has taken me months and it is still an unfinished piece!</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>


                            <p>Following my "apple saga," I became more adventurous. I enrolled in acrylic classes -
                                just more art lessons, I thought, but to my surprise, I got something I did not bargain
                                for - a new and fun creative experience!</p>

                            <p>I have always pride myself on having an end in mind and I put in a lot of effort to plan
                                my journey. My art teacher challenged my conventions to not just produce masterpieces
                                but to take the road less taken, towards self-discovery. The tangible outcome was
                                immaterial.</p>

                            <p>My art lessons turned out to be a life‚Äêchanging experience. I underwent a total paradigm
                                shift. The sessions evolved into my personal creativity journey. Each lesson taught me
                                something new because it forced me out of my comfort zone. I took risks and squeezed
                                every single drop of my creative juices onto bare canvas. I exercised my right brain
                                like never before, and the more I did, the better I felt.</p>

                            <div class="img-block">
                                <div class="img-wrp">

                                    <p>Now I am an "artist" in my own right. Every piece I paint is my masterpiece.
                                        There is no
                                        other like mine. Over two years have passed and I have matured from merely
                                        deriving
                                        pleasure from seeing and showing off my completed "masterpieces" to discovering
                                        the
                                        powerful lessons in art that have changed my life.</p>

                                    <p>It is about creativity and me! </p>
