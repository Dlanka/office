                                <p>These activities have resulted in 30% of the working population having some form of life insurance (2.6 million life insurance policies are in force as at December 2014). There are 4.6 million general insurance policies in force, including 2.2 million 3rd party motor insurance policies which is a compulsory requirement in Sri Lanka (2014 data). </p>
                                <p>Despite the relatively low penetration levels, the above statistics clearly reflect the significant impact the insurance industry has made on the socio-economic landscape of Sri Lanka.</p>

                                <p>Following appointment of industry professionals to the posts of Chairman and CEO of the NITF, the working relationship between IASL and NITF improved considerably. </p>
                                <p>The NITF successfully negotiated a reinsurance programme to mitigate the risk associated with the 30% compulsory cession. In a move welcomed by all general insurers, a profit commission scheme for non motor SRCC and Terrorism fund was reintroduced in 2016. Several other technical matters were also resolved between IASL and NITF in an amicable manner. </p>
                                <p>IASL members have taken note of the following proposals by NITF Chairman, and have already commenced direct interactions to pursue matters of mutual benefit: </p>

                                <p>Members of the Finance Technical Sub Committee (FTSC) are continuing discussions with representatives of the MoF and Inland Revenue Department (IRD) to arrive at a sustainable basis for taxing life company profits. The discussions followed the budget proposal to define management expenses for the life business. </p>
                                <p>In addition, the IASL continued to lobby for state business to be opened to private sector insurers (based on a suitable rating) and to resolve the long standing dispute related to VAT on reinsurance recoveries on claims and reinsurance commissions.  </p>
                                <p>The budget proposal to withdraw luxury and semi luxury taxes which is currently being collected by general insurers may not be enacted. </p>
                                <p>Preliminary discussions were also had with regard to IASL supporting to set up a viable pension scheme in Sri Lanka. This matter will be pursued at the appropriate time.</p>

                                <h4>Activities of the Life Insurance Forum (LIF)  </h4>
                                <p>Members of the LIF continued to play a vital role in supporting the IASL ExCo on technical matters pertaining to the life business. </p>

                                <h5>Achievements</h5>
                                <p>The LIF finalised a pool of 213 doctors and 236 laboratories to conduct medical examinations at the point of underwriting a policy for the entire life insurance industry. This was an outcome of a national level initiative which was supported by all insurance companies, who willingly shared the resources used by respective companies. This initiative is expected to enhance customer service while reducing underwriting leakage. </p>
                                <p>At the request of the IBSL, and facilitated by LIF, life insurers agreed to implement a common / standard cooling off period for life insurance policies. To facilitate this change, IBSL extended the time period to hand over policies to customers to 14 days (instead of 7 days). </p>
                                <p>LIF members commenced sharing life insurance premiums on an accrual basis to ensure that figures shared among members were consistent with figures published by listed companies.</p>

                                <h5>Continuous Professional Development (CPD) </h5>
                                <p>As in previous years, the LIF conducted CPD and other programmes with the support of the Sri Lanka Insurance Institute (SLII) facilitated by resource persons from Munich Re, Hannover Re and RGA. These programmes catered to entry level as well as senior technical staff involved in underwriting and claims functions. </p>

An initiative by an IASL member to update other members on fraudulent motor claims practices sets a positive tone for industry participants to continue to share best practices for mutual benefit. </p>
                                <h5>Coordination with other Sub Committees </h5>

                                <p>Accordingly, seminars were conducted in the Wayamba and Sabaragamuwa universities. A first of its kind residential programme was conducted in the latter university, at which approximately 50 students participated.

                                <p>Schools programmes were conducted in Central Province while arrangements are being made to conduct programmes in the Southern and Northern Provinces as well.   </p>
                                <p>Several public relations programmes and “Employer Branding” programmes were also conducted to attract school leavers to insurance industry. </p>
                                <p>The HRSC played a key role in lobbying IBSL to set minimum qualifications and training requirements for permanent employees who canvass business.
