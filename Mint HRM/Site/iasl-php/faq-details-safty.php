                                </div> 
                                <p>Wikipedia defines insurance as “the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another in exchange for money”. However, in Sri Lanka, as well as in other Asian countries, only a minority of the population possess some form of insurance. Mr. Dirk Pereira, President of the Insurance Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) stated that about 30% of the working population of the country has some form of insurance. In an interview conducted with Mr. Pereira, he spoke about the importance of having a life insurance and how the IASL plans to increase awareness among the general public. </p>
                                <div class="col-lg-11 ">
                                    <p ><b>Why is having a life insurance important?</b></p>
                                    <p itemprop="description">Life is uncertain. You have to have a foundation on which you build your future. Anyone anywhere has certain needs; protection is a need, health could be a need, long tern saving could be a need. These needs can potentially be met long term by life insurance. So it is different to other financial services product because there is an element of protection. We are creating a financial safety net for people.</p
                                    <p itemprop="description">You have to be aware that you might not be able to control every element of your life. In the event that you can’t control your life, you should leave behind a safety net so that you or your family can continue to maintain a similar lifestyle, pursue their aspirations, fulfill their commitments etc. </p

                                    <p itemprop="description"><b>Despite the benefits found in getting a life insurance, this is an area that is often neglected. Why is that?</b></p>
                                    <p itemprop="description">There is a lack of awareness among people. Affordability is also a problem. Insurance percentage in terms of the national economy is quite low. That is where we have a disconnection to resolve. Obviously, as income grows and awareness increases, there will be a huge potential for life insurance as well as general insurance.</p>

                                    <p itemprop="description"><b>As the IASL, how are you planning to enhance awareness among the people?</b></p>
                                    <p itemprop="description">A lot of activities are driven individually throughout the year by various companies. Insurance companies, the regulator and the insurance ombudsman do a lot of activities to enhance awareness about insurance. As the IASL, we have commenced ground level activities to create awareness in the month of September with the support of 15 life insurance member companies and the regulator. </p>
                                    <p itemprop="description">Mr. Pereira further mentioned that the IASL is planning to create awareness among at least 1 million people in the month of September and that the Insurance Association hopes to conduct an industry activation for general insurance in the coming year</p>
